# CLEANED-RX

[CLEANED X](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/91205) is a rapid ex-ante environmental impact assessment tool that allows users to explore multiple impacts of developing livestock value chains. It models the impact of changes in the livestock production systems and value chains along several pathways on land use, productivity, economics, water impacts, greenhouse gas emissions, and soil health.

[CLEANED R](https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/78474) is a quick, ex-ante and spatially explicit environmental impact assessment tool for assessing changes from transforming livestock value chains. The development of the tool has been funded by DFID, Livestock CRP, and PIM CRP.

This is the first step towards refining the two models into CLEANED-RX: Comprehensive Livestock Environmental Assessment for Improved Nutrition, a Secured Environment, and Sustainable Development along Livestock and Fish Value Chains.
